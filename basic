1.Variable naming
Rules for naming conventions

[ ]
# Right Variable Declaration
num_students = 25
[ ]
total_sales = 1000.50
[ ]
student_name = "AI"
[ ]
print("Hello world")
account_circle
Hello world
[ ]
# Print variable values
print( num_students)
account_circle
25
[ ]
print(total_sales)
account_circle
1000.5
[ ]
print(student_name)
account_circle
AI
2- Data types
In computer programming, data types specify the type of data that can be stored inside a variable.

2.1. Data Type: Numeric

int : 12
float : 12.45
complex : 1+2j
2.2. Data Type: String

str : "The future of AI"
[ ]
num = 23
[ ]
num
account_circle
23
Above, 23 (an integer) is assigned to the "num" variable. So the data type of num is of the int.

[ ]
course = "Umer"
[ ]
print(course)
account_circle
Umer
Above, "Hope to Skills Free AI Course" (a String) is assigned to the "course" variable. So the data type of course is of the string.

[ ]
marks = 85.63
Above, "85.63" (a float) is assigned to the "marks" variable. So the data type of marks is of the float.

[ ]
complex_number = 1+2j
[ ]
complex_number
account_circle
(1+2j)
Above, "1+2j" (a complex number) is assigned to the "complex_number" variable. So the data type of complex_number is of the complex.

Task#01
Assign values to variables and display their value.

[ ]
#Assign any String to variable
i="umer"
print(i)
account_circle
umer
[ ]
#Assign any Integer value to variable
i=2
print(i)
account_circle
2
[ ]
# Assign any Float Value to Variable
i=2.5
print(i)
account_circle
2.5
Operators
(+) addition
(-) subtraction
/ division
** exponentiation
% modulus (remainder after division)
Comparison Operators are discussed Later
Python has incorporated operators like +=, but ++ (or --) do not work in Python
[ ]
# Multiply two numbers
print(3*4)
account_circle
12
[ ]
# Display calculate square of number
print(3**2)
account_circle
9
[ ]
# Calculate the Remainder
print(16%5)
account_circle
1
[ ]
# Divide two numbers
a = 5.0/10.0
a
account_circle
0.5
[ ]
# Calculate the Quotient of two numbers
b= 11//4
b
account_circle
2
Adding two integers
[ ]
num1 = 5
num2 = 2
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
account_circle
7
simple program to calculate the area of Rectangle
area of rectangle = length * height

[ ]
# Simple program to calculate the area of rectangle

length = 2.5
height = 3.5
area = length * height
print(area)
account_circle
8.75
